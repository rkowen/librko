reverse.c - is an ANSI C code that reads the lines from either the
files on the commandline or from stdin and outputs all lines to
stdout.

The other day I needed to take a file and reverse the lines within
it so I came up with this code.

This program reads each line and stores it in memory in a linked
list structure and then outputs from the last structure to the
first.

To make the executable, first edit the Makefile to tailor it to your
environment, then execute the following:
	make
	make install
To uninstall everything do the following:
	make uninstall
To clean everything do:
	make clobber
