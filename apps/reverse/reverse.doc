     NAME
          reverse - reverse the order of lines from a bunch of files
          or from stdin.

     SYNOPSIS
          reverse [-h][--] [file [file]...]

     DESCRIPTION
          reverse reads through the given files and collects the lines
          into memory and outputs all lines in reverse order to
          stdout.  It's the opposite of `cat'ing a file.

     OPTIONS
          -h          Printout the usage message to stderr.

          --          ends the options list so that files the begin
                      with `-' and be processed.

     FILES
          /u/wk/rkowen/bin/reverse

     SEE ALSO
          sort(1),cat(1),randomize(1)

     DIAGNOSTICS
          Lack of memory will give diagnostic messages and terminates
          further processing.  Unreadable files also give messages,
          but does not stop further processing.

     BUGS
          The input line length is limited to 2048 characters.  It
          does not notify whether the input line was truncated.
