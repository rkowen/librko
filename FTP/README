This directory receives the gzipped tar balls of some of the
stand-alone applications.

This file is mostly here to make the directory non-empty.

To create all the apps do "make alltgz" in the librko root directory.

To create just a single one do "make FTP/xxx.tgz" in the librko root
directory, and where xxx is the application.
